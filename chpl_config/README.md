# Chapel configuration scripts

This directory contains some predefined Chapel configuration scripts targeting
the following GPU-accelerated systems:
- the [Iris](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/iris/) supercomputer;
- the [Grid5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home) testbed.

By default, each script is expected to download, configure and build the latest
version of Chapel.
